                <div class="case-overview">
                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>This case study examines how Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC transformed their Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) practices to fully integrate families as active participants in care and decision-making.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>Children's National PICU is a 44-bed unit serving critically ill children from the Washington metropolitan area and beyond. Prior to their PFCC initiative, the unit had restrictive visiting policies and limited family involvement in care processes.</p>
                
                <h4>PFCC Transformation</h4>
                <div style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <h5>Key Elements of the PICU Family Involvement Model:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Family Presence Policy:</strong> Eliminated traditional "visiting hours" in favor of 24/7 family access, with accommodations for overnight stays</li>
                        <li><strong>Family-Centered Rounds:</strong> Structured daily rounds to include families as active participants, not just observers</li>
                        <li><strong>Parent Education Program:</strong> Comprehensive education to prepare parents for participation in care activities</li>
                        <li><strong>Parent Support Network:</strong> System connecting experienced PICU families with newly admitted families</li>
                        <li><strong>Family Participation Menu:</strong> Tool allowing families to indicate their desired level of involvement in specific care activities</li>
                        <li><strong>Family-Staff Communication Boards:</strong> Bedside tools to enhance information sharing and goal alignment</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Implementation Process</h4>
                    <p>The PICU transformation followed a structured change management approach:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Conducted surveys and focus groups with families and staff to identify gaps in family-centered care</li>
                        <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Formed a multidisciplinary team including parents to design the new model</li>
                        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Provided comprehensive training for all PICU staff on new processes and family engagement skills</li>
                        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Phased rollout of individual components with continuous refinement</li>
                        <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Systematic measurement of impact on families, patients, staff, and clinical outcomes</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                
                <h4>Overcoming Challenges</h4>
                <p>The implementation team encountered several challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Staff Concerns:</strong> Some staff initially worried about increased workload, interference with care, and privacy issues</li>
                    <li><strong>Space Constraints:</strong> The physical environment needed modifications to accommodate family presence</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Barriers:</strong> Diverse family backgrounds required adaptations to the standard approach</li>
                    <li><strong>Workflow Disruption:</strong> Existing clinical workflows needed redesign to incorporate family participation</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These challenges were addressed through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Staff champions from each discipline who modeled and promoted new practices</li>
                    <li>Creative space utilization and minor renovations</li>
                    <li>Cultural competence training and multilingual resources</li>
